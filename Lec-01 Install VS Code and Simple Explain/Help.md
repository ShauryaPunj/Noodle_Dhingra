# 🎯 What This HTML Code Does (Explained for Humans)

---

## 🏗 The Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    Hi this is Shaurya Punj
    <video src="Trance.mp4" controls></video>
</body>
</html>



📖 Explanation (Line by Line)
<!DOCTYPE html>
Tells the browser: “Hey, this is an HTML5 document.”

<html lang="en">
Starts the HTML page.

lang="en" → Language is English (helps accessibility & SEO).

<head> … </head>
The brain of the webpage.
Contains meta information (not shown directly to visitors).

<meta charset="UTF-8">
Makes sure all text (including emojis and special characters) displays correctly.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Makes the page responsive on mobile devices.

Without this, your site could look zoomed out on phones.

<title>Document</title>
Sets the name shown in the browser tab.

<body> … </body>
The face of the webpage — everything inside here is visible to the user.

Hi this is Shaurya Punj
Just plain text that will show on the page.

<video src="Trance.mp4" controls></video>
Embeds a video player on the page.

src="Trance.mp4" → Path to the video file.

controls → Shows play, pause, volume, fullscreen buttons.

🖼 What It Looks Like in a Browser
Top Tab: Says “Document”.

On the Page:

A text line → “Hi this is Shaurya Punj”.

A video player → Plays Trance.mp4 with all controls.
