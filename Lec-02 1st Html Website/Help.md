## 🏷️ HTML Basics – My Little Skeleton 🦴
Sooo, HTML is like the **bones of my website**, giving it structure! 🏗️  

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` → This lil’ thingy tells the browser, *"Hey, I’m modern HTML, be nice!"* 😎  
- `<html lang="en">` → We’re keeping it classy in English, babes! 🗣️  
- `<head>` → Fancy top hat 🎩 where we put **meta info, title & links**.  
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` → Makes sure our emojis 💖✨ don’t get all wonky.  
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width= , initial-scale=1.0">` → So it looks cute on phones too 📱💕  
  - `<title>` → The name in the tab! Mine’s *Shaurya Punj* ✨  
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` → Linking my **CSS magic wand** 🪄  

- `<body>` → This is like the **living room of my website**, where all the fun stuff happens! 🏡

## 🎨 CSS – Styling Queen 👑
CSS is the **makeup and outfit** of your website 💅💖  

- I made my **background greenyellow** 🍏💛 because vibes  
- Text is **black** 🖤 so it pops like aesthetic TikTok captions  
- Example:  
```css
body {
    background-color: greenyellow;
    color: black;
}

## 🖱️ JavaScript – The Website Energy ⚡

JS is literally the **sparkle juice** that makes websites alive ✨

* I added a cute lil welcome popup:

```js
alert("Welcome to Shaurya Punj website");
```

* Tip: Always put `<script src="script.js"></script>` **at the end of body** so your HTML loads first 🐣💻

---

## 💌 Quick Linking Tips

* **CSS** goes in `<head>` under the title so your website looks stylish from the get-go 🥰
* **JS** goes just **before `</body>`** so the page doesn’t freak out 🫶

That’s it cuties! 💖 Now my website is basically **a tiny, happy, greenyellow world** with style, sass, and sparkle! 🌟🌈
